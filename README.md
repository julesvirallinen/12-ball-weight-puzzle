Someone showed me the 12 ball weight riddle, and I tried to find an online tool to try and figure it out visually. Couldn't really find one, so made this quickly. 

## Puzzle

You have 12 balls identical in size and appearance but 1 is an odd weight (could be either light or heavy).

You have a weighing scale with no measurements so you can just compare weight of balls against each other. You have only 3 chances to weigh the balls in any combination using the scales. Determine which ball is the odd one and if itâ€™s heavier or lighter than the rest. How do you do it?
